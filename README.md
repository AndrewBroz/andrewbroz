- Hi, I’m @AndrewBroz!
- I’m primarily interested in music software (including livecoding enviroments), signal processing, natural language processing & language models.
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything that seems fun in those spaces or projects related to music, math, science, languages, or art.
- You can reach me here, on Mastodon (https://macaw.social/@abroz), or on other social networks as @AndrewBroz.
