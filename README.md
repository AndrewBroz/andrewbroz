- Hi, I’m @AndrewBroz!
- I’m primarily interested in music software (including livecoding enviroments), signal processing & natural language processing.
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything that seems fun in those spaces or projects related to math, science, or art.
- You can reach me here, on Mastodon (https://macaw.social/@abroz), or on Twitter (https://twitter.com/AndrewBroz).
