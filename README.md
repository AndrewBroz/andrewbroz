- Hi, I’m @AndrewBroz!
- I currently work as an AI risk analyst.
- My professional experience is in REST API development & full stack web tech (ex-Postman, ex-Twitter).
- I’m primarily interested in music software, signal processing, natural language processing, & language models.
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything in those spaces or projects related to music, math, science, languages, or art.
- You can reach me here, on X (https://x.com/andrewbroz), or on other social networks as @AndrewBroz.
